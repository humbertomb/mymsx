Anatom√≠a del Aparato Digestivo

MSX program I developed when I was 15 (1985), together with two high school colleagues. 

This is a didactical program for MSX1 computers, written in BASIC, and indeed the larger BASIC program I wrote. It uses the full 28k available in MSX BASIC, and it was stored in a datasette. We were so short of memory that we did not include instructions in the program. As there are only 24k available in MSX DISK BASIC, I had to split the program into pieces so that it can be run from MSX-DOS.

The program shows some lessons on the human digestive system. There are some pictures of the different parts of the anatomy, with explanations. The user is also able to perform an examination to verify his/her understanding of the matter
