Simphony

This is a programa I submitted to the 'II Concurso Nacional de ProgramaciÃ³n MSX' (2nd National MSX Programming 
Contest) hosted by Sony in 1987, in which I finished in the third position. The programm is mostly coded in Z80 assembler,
except a very small BASIC program loader.

The source files have been editing with Geany, and the compiled code has been obatained with Z80 Assembler Glass

If you want to try it, either load SIMPHONY.DSK into the OpenMSX emulator, or copy SIMPHONY.BAS, SIMPHONY.BIN and
SIMPHONY.SC2 to your MSX computer (i.e. in a 3.5" disk). In orther to excute it, from the MSX-DOS prompt type:

a> BASIC SIMPHONY.BAS
