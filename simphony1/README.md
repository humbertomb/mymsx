Simphony

This is a program I submitted to the 'II Concurso de Programas MSX' (2nd MSX Programms Contest) hosted 
by Sony in 1986, in which I finished in the third position. The program is mostly coded in Z80 assembler,
except a very small BASIC program loader.

The source files have been edited with Geany, and the compiled code has been obtained with Z80 Assembler Glass

If you want to try it, either load SIMPHONY.DSK into the OpenMSX emulator, or copy SIMPHONY.BAS, SIMPHONY.BIN and
SIMPHONY.SC2 to your MSX computer (i.e. in a 3.5" disk). In order to excute it, from the MSX-DOS prompt type:

A> BASIC SIMPHONY.BAS
