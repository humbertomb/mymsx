# mymsx
MSX code I have developed, mostly during the 80s

This repository is intended to be a compilation of some of the software I have developed for the MSX computers

I have packed the code in several forlders, one for each interesting program. The files are stored in different formats:

- '.BAS' Microsoft BASIC encoded source file
- '.ASC' ASCII encoded BASIC source file
- '.CAS' Casette emualation format, for use in OpenMSX
- '.DSK' Diskette emulation format, for use in OpenMSX
- '.BIN' binary encoded assembler executable file
- '.COM' MSX-DOS encoded assembler executable file

Currently, I am having some fun not only recovering these old programs, but also modifying them and even creating new ones. Check here for periodic updates.
